Hi David,
You can find here the source code in "mainWindow.py" along with all the ressource files.
That will be our first version of the project (Without any functionnalities).
Now you have to add these fonctionnalities.

Some important details about the variables name:
label_5: the text under the left magnet
label_6: the text under the right magnet

I defined approriate slots that you need to fill.
Tell me if there is a problem,
Raphael.
