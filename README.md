# Target-B

## Abstract

Target-B is a project from the Hebrew university of Jerusalem, made by two students for their engineering project. It has been carried out with the collaboration of the professor Nadav Katz from the Hebrew university, and Yoav Mintz, from Hadassah Ein Karem. It uses principles of electromagnetism and it is designed for a medical purpose.
